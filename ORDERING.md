# Ordering info
These options are what I have used to order with JLCPCB. Feel free to tweak if you want, but this is what I recommend!
If an option isn't specified, assume it's the default.

- 2 layers
- Delivery format: Panel by JLCPCB.
  - Optional - this is just a whole lot cheaper!
  - Choose whatever panel size you want - I've had good luck with 2x5 boards and 5mm edges.
- 1.6mm thickness
- Black board color, or something else if you're feeling it!
- If you care about the art and aesthetics, go with ENIG. If you want em as cheap as possible, go with either of the HASLs.
- Mark on PCB: Remove mark. This removes the JLCPCB auto order number that's otherwise arbitrarily placed on your silkscreen
- PCB assembly: Top layer.
  - Unless you're changing something here, just click through the prompts.
