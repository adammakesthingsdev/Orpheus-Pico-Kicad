# Orpheus Pico
## About this repo
Welcome to the Kicad port of the Orpheus Pico, Hack Club's very own Raspberry Pi Pico compatible microcontroller!
This repository contains both the project files and built gerbers for ordering through JLCPCB.
Please note, **ordering is at your own risk**: I will not be held accountable if you have problems due to mistakes made ordering or issues with the project.

## Ordering
For information on ordering these boards, please refer to ORDERING.md.

## Licensing / other info
An official license for this project is TBD.
For now, you can:
- Use this project for inspiration and derivatives
- Order Orpheus Picos for **non-commercial** purposes: This means you cannot sell them, even at cost

Please get in touch with me (@adammakesthings on Hack Club Slack or adam@hackclub.com) if you are planning on selling Orpheus Picos or ordering large quantities.  

My final ask is that if you order any Orpheus Picos for any reason, I ask that you please keep my name and attribution on them. Again, please get in touch if this doesn't work for you.
